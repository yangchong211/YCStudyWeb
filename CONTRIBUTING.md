# Contributing Guide

## Overview

This repository employs a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) setup with [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), and hosts a number of associated but separated packages.

- The `plugins` directory contains all the official plugins.
- The `themes` directory contains all the official themes.

## Development Setup

Pre-requirement:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 18.16.0+**
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) **version 8+**

Clone the repo, and install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build source code:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Main tools that used in this project:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) + [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code linting and formatting

## Scripts

### `pnpm build`

The `build` script uses `tsc` to compile TypeScript source files to JavaScript dist files.

Also, it will copy necessary resources from source directory to dist directory, because some source files (e.g. `.vue`, `.css` files) would not be processed by `tsc`, but should keep the same relative path in the dist directory.

You may need to run this script first after your clone this repository, because the dist files are ignored by `.gitignore`.

### `pnpm clean`

The `clean` script runs `clean` script in all packages, cleaning all the dist files and caches. In other words, it will remove all the files that generated by `build` script.

It's used before you want to re-build source files from a clean / initial state.

### `pnpm format`

The `format` script uses Prettier to format all source files.

### `pnpm lint`

The `lint` script uses ESLint to check all source files.

### `pnpm test`

The `test` script uses Vitest to run unit testings.
